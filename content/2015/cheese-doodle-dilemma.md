Title: The Cheese Doodle Dilemma
Slug: cheese-doodle-dilemma
Summary: Some have claimed cheese doodles, the ambrosia of the modern world, are directly linked with nightmares. In this post, I will finally shed light on the age-old question: Do cheese doodle molecules negatively interfere with neurotransmitters while sleeping? 
 
As a child, my mother believed the consumption of cheese doodles after dinner enticed the boogeyman. This may sound like 
a ridiculous allegation, but luckily the line between sensible and silly is extremely blurry at my old age. So, with 
this mindset, I decided to run a three-week experiment, where I would eat a handful of cheese doodles before falling 
asleep each night. Here's the result:

Before jumping to any conclusions, let's run a simple one-sample test-of-proportions hypothesis test. 

**Null Hypothesis:** Cheese doodles are a wonderful culinary treat <br/>
**Alternative Hypothesis:** Lucifer is here on earth in cheese doodle form 

After some number crunching, I calculated a t-statistic of 10.1, which is quite a bit bigger than it's critical value of 2.8 
(&alpha;=0.01). So, I'm forced to reject the null hypothesis and recommend that everyone AVOID EATING CHEESE DOODLES 
AT ALL COST BEFORE BED!!!
