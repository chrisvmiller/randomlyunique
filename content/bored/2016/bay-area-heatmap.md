Title: Bay Area Heatmap
Category: bored
Slug: bay-area-heatmap
Summary: As a recent Bay Area transplant, I decided to summarize my time in Frisco with a nifty frequently-visited Heatmap.  
 
After a few years in the Bay Area, my wife (she's lived in SF for over 20 years!)
and I decided to move to the almost literal greener pasture of Seattle. While sitting 
in my 1994 SF-priced downtown Seattle apartment (with a frigging washer/dryer and dishwasher),
I decided to aggregate my phones location data. The heatmap below filters out where I lived 
and worked, while plotting the logarithm of my phones recorded location count:

Cool observations: 

* You can clearly see my morning Embarcadero coffee walk into work
* This common conversation: "ok, it's Saturday night at 10pm - where should we go?" "Umm, pretty sure the Mission is the only place open at those late hours"
* My incredibly beloved BART ride to where I lived in Berkeley (I can still hear BARTs melodic banshee wail in my dreams)
