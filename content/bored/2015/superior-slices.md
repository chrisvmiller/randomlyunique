Summary: Curious if the pizza you just ordered will be good? If so, sit back and grab a regular kah-fee while this New Yorker gives you the definitive guide to awesome pizza.
 
As a native New Yorker, I take my pizza seriously and I always feel obliged to (unannoyingly) share this passion with
anyone in my vicinity. So, as a community service, I created this handy-dandy map for my world-wide recommendations for great pizza.

Yeah, so if you aren't in New York (this obviously doesn't include upstate New York), then just Fuhgedaboudit.
