Title: Lunar Effect
Category: bored
Slug: lunar-effect
Summary: As a child, my mother always warned me about the number of active mischievians during the full moon. Is there a correlation between devious behavior and the phases of the moon or did my mother just enjoy scaring me? Let's find out!


Does the lunar cycle affect behavior in animals?  Of course not. But, to appease my raw gluten-free vegan readers,
let's compare crimes in San Francisco with the phases of the moon! The plot below counts every crime during the new or
full moon in San Francisco for the year 2014 between the hours of 9pm and 5am:

Well, this certainly makes sense. If I'm a dude about to commit a crime, I would wait until it's really dark out -
that's like day one of ninja school.
