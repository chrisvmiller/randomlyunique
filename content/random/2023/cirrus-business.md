Summary: Help Cloudi and his friends restore their home in this story-driven farming video game!

For the past few years, my wife and I have spent a rather significant amount of time working on our unique twist on a farming video game. Unlike most games in this genre, the goal isn't to amass money or achieve "friendship" via gift-giving. Instead, the player and a menagerie of oddball NPCs work together to cleanup the in-game environment by growing an assortment of magical crops. Be sure to check it out on Steam and the Nintendo Switch!
