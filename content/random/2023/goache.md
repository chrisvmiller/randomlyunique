Summary: I present the star of my preteen Dragon Ball/Final Fantasy/Myst mashup masterpiece.

In elementary school, my teachers replaced my precious recess period with a remedial writing class. So, like any sensible child with the need to play outside, I decided to dive headfirst into the art of fanfic to levelup my lackluster writing ability. After a half a dozen months and 150 or so pages, I crafted a story that followed my original character 'Goache' in search of the magical dragon cupcake. Here's an old drawing of him:

And thanks to Goache, I tallied up enough writing practice to successfully escape my lunch-time purgatory.
