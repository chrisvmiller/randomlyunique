Summary: I present the star of my preteen Dragon Ball/Final Fantasy/Myst mashup masterpiece.

In elementary school, my writing skills were so horrible that my teachers replaced my precious recess period with a remedial writing class. So, like any sensible child with the need to play outside, I decided to write some fanfic to improve my lackluster writing abilities. The end result of this approximately 150 page story, followed my original character 'Goache' in search of the magical dragon cupcake. Here's an old drawing of him:

And thanks to Goache, I was able to tally up enough writing practice to successfully escape my lunch-time purgatory the following school year.
