Title: Millnotes
Category: random
Slug: millnotes
Summary: The Millnotes are a comprehensive set of the most commonly looked up physics and mathematics tidbits.  If you're an undergradate physics, math or engineering student - this sheet should be pretty helpful!

As an undergraduate physics and mathematics student, I frequently needed to look up physical constants, trig identities,
the curl in spherical coordinates and a bunch of other formulas. Eventually, I compiled all my notes together and created this handy-dandy reference 
sheet! (<a class="nounderline" href="https://github.com/chrisvmiller/analytics/blob/master/millnotes/millnotes.pdf">Download</a>)
