Title: Hasta la Palindrome
Category: random
Slug: hasta-la-palindrome
Summary: An esoteric programming language is like a pet rock - despite its pointlessness, the occasional walk is always entertaining

As a tech worker, I can unequivocally state that the only thing more important than debating coding 
styles or following Agile methodologies is the ability to rapidly whiteboard algorithms. So, if
you're ever asked to write a palindrome checker during a tech screen, be sure to impress 
the interviewer with this beauty written in ArnoldC - an Arnold Schwarzenegger themed programming language
