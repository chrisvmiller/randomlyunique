Title: Steel Nameplate
Category: random
Slug: steel-nameplate
Summary: Anyone can drop a few dollars on a custom nameplate, but my inner smithy wouldn't allow that!

The nameplate on my desk is an amalgamation of milled and plasma-cutted letters MIG 
welded onto a steel L-shaped frame. And, as a self proclaimed master crocheter, I highlighted
my self-built nameplate with a rainbow doily.
