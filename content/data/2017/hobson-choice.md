Title: Hobson's Survival Choice
Category: data
Slug: hobson-choice
Summary: If you're an animal wanting to get off the endangered species list, then look no further than this menu of insightful tips. 

Why are some animals more endangered than others? Is it loss of habitat, over hunting, or perhaps 
it's a more intrinsic property like an animal's cuteness, scariness or tastiness? 

In order to explore this last question, I spent $40 and submitted a survey to Amazon's Mechanical Turk. 
This survey consisted of 300 randomly selected animal pictures spanning over three different conservation
statuses: Least Concerned, Threatened, and Endangered. After each image was rated multiple times,
I compiled this following chart:

So, in order to assure your species survival, I would definitely recommend investing 
in big-round-eye plastic surgery or (at the very least) make sure you taste good next 
to a side of potatoes.
