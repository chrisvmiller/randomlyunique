Title: Seattle Heatmap
Category: data
Slug: seattle-heatmap
Summary: After living in Seattle for a year, I decided to sequelize my Bay Area frequently-visited heatmap blog post! 

Seattle is a wonderful city dotted with mediocre Starbucks coffee shops, Amazon construction 
sites and a beautiful coastal line obscured by the majestic Alaskan highway. After living downtown 
for over a year, I aggregated my phones location data and plotted the logarithm of the 
recorded location count:

If I plot the radial distance away from my home on a semilog chart, a
linear fit gives an exponential diffusion length (average distance away from home) 
of 2.1km - which falls perfectly inline with a person who hasn't owned a car in 
over a decade!
