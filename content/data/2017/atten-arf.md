Summary: My little Shih Tzu is surprisingly well behaved and obedient despite his breed's notoriously stubborn reputation. Nevertheless, his command responsiveness seems situational, so let's dig in this article and retrieve an analysis.      

Bubba, the little creature that chills in my apartment, is surprisingly intelligent for a Shih Tzu. In fact, there are few things more

In order to investigate Bubba's obedience patterns, I decided to track a few features each time a command is issued. These features range
