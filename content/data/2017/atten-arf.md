Summary: My little Shih Tzu is surprisingly well behaved and obedient despite his breed's notoriously stubborn reputation. Nevertheless, his responsiveness still seems somewhat situational, so let's dig into this article and retrieve an analysis.      

Bubba, the little pupper that chills in my apartment, is surprisingly intelligent for a Shih Tzu. In fact, there are few things more

In order to explore Bubba's obedience influencers, I decided to track a few features each time a command is given. These features range 
from the person giving the command, the tone of voice, if a treat or toy was involved, the time of day, and if Bubba was already active/alert. 
After filling out a spreadsheet over the course of a month, a feature importance calculation via a Random Forest Classifier yields:
