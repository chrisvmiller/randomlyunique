Slug: alien-outbreak
Summary: If you dread a potential alien abduction, then grab that tinfoil hat and study this scientifically constructed avoidance map.

Despite a constant stream of sightings, news outlets repeatedly fail to address the current UFO epidemic. Luckily, I created 
a vital spatial autocorrelation for those wise individuals who always tuck their feet under the covers before
bed (a surefire alien defense). The map below identifies statistically significant UFO hot spots (normalized per capita) 
via the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic:

*These UFO observations, taken over the last 20 years, are sourced from <a href=http://nuforc.org/>nuforc.org</a> 
and assumed to be a 100% accurate depiction of extraterrestrial encounters.
