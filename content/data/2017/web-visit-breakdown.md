Category: data
Slug: web-visit-breakdown
Summary: Are you like me and sometimes wonder about where your time is spent online? If so, let me just skip to the punchline and suggest closing this window and venturing outside for a walk.

After unconsciously visiting gmail two dozen times within the last hour, I acquired the urge 
to quantify my web usage behaviour. Surely, checking websites at this frequency wasn't normal - right? 

Alas, after compiling a year's worth of web history, this definitely wasn't 
the exception to the rule. So, in order to obscure some depressingly large numbers 
while still showing my web usage, I'll just present the data as everyone's 
favorite-to-hate visualization - a pie chart:
