Title: Obligatory Twitter Sentiment Post
Category: data
Slug: obligatory-twitter-sentiment-post
Summary: What kind of slacker has a data science blog for over four years and forgets a sentiment analysis of Twitter data. Let's fix this!

The Twittersphere plays a completely unconcerning vital role in modern society. Now, 
let's use Twitter to it's full potential and expose humanity's feelings towards popular 
candies!

After pinging the Twitter API for over a week, I trained a Bayesian classifier to split 
these candy tweets into positive and negative categories. I also extracted out the
most common emoji for each sentiment as shown in the (questionably useful) Sankey 
diagram below:

Other than the unusual amount of death emoji laced candy tweets, I completely agree 
with Twitter's candy assignment!
