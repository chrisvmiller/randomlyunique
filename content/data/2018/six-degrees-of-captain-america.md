Summary: Which super hero is the Kevin Bacon of the Marvel Comic Universe? (Spoiler Alert: The Title)

Acting has Kevin Bacon, mathematics has Paul Erdos, but who is the most prolific 
Marvel character? Given a Marvel themed graph where each node is a superhero
and each edge is a comic book, what is the best way to find the most connected character? 

After dusting off my old Computer Science 101 textbook, I defined a character's
connectedness as the average minimum distance (found via a breadth first search) to 
every node within the graph. With this definition in hand, Marvel's top five most connected
characters in order are:

CAPTAIN AMERICA <br>
SPIDER-MAN      
IRON MAN        
THING           
MR. FANTASTIC

In fact, even Chris Miller - the powerful and all knowing Sheriff of Anchorage, Alaska - has 
a close connection to Captain American!
