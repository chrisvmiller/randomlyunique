Title: Sturgeon's Law
Category: data
Slug: sturgeons-law
Summary: Theodore Sturgeon, the semifamous American SciFi author, stumbled upon arguably the most comprehensive law of nature. 

Sturgeon's Law, despite being quite the underestimate to any non-goldfish entity, unequivocally states that "ninety percent of everything is crap." As a homage to this fundamental truth, I plotted this blog's organic web traffic per post - which shows a sharp Sturgeonesque decline after the top 5 posts!
