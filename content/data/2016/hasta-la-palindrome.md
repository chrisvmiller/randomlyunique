Title: Hasta la Palindrome
Category: data
Slug: hasta-la-palindrome
Summary: An esoteric programming language is like a pet rock - kinda pointless, but I'll still walk it every once in awhile. In this post, I'll check for palindromes in an Arnold Schwarzenegger themed programming language!
 
As a tech worker, I can unequivocally state that the only thing more important than debating coding 
styles or following Agile methodologies is the ability to rapidly whiteboard algorithms. So, if
you're ever asked to write a palindrome detector during a data science screen, be sure to impress 
the interviewer with this beauty, written in <a href=http://lhartikk.github.io/ArnoldC/>ArnoldC</a>:
