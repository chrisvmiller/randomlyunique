Title: The Broccalypse
Category: data
Slug: broccalypse
Summary: California is currently in a drought and we use 10% of our water supply on almonds. I love a good almond biscotti as much as the next dude, but that seems kinda wasteful. Couldn't we grow     better water conserving crops?

In an ideal world, everyone would live on cactus. It's high in antioxidants, vitamins and dietary fiber
while needing very little water to grow. However, the demand for cactus is super low and its price suffers.
So, how could farmers sustain a drought-stricken population such as California and still optimize revenue? (farmers still
need to make-it-rain, regardless of actual rainfall) The table below summarizes the water usage, caloric intake and
market price for the most popular crops in Calfornia:

Let's now determine the best crop(s) that will minimize water usage, generate 10 billion dollars in revenue and will provide all
40 million Californians with a 2000 Calorie diet. Oh wait, this sounds like our good ol' friend Mr. Linear Programming problem.
The solution is quite disturbing:

<table class="table-bordered" style="margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;">
<thead>
    <tr>
      <th class="text-center" style="width: 200px; color:green; font-size: 200%;" >80% Broccoli</th>
      <th class="text-center" style="width: 200px; color:red; font-size: 200%;" >20% Tomatoes</th>
    </tr>
</table> 
</talble>

So, as responsible citizens, we must: <br>
  1) Stop making fun of the weirdos who eat tomatoes like apples <br>
  2) Prepare the children for the upcoming Broccalypse
