Summary: Curious if the pizza you just ordered will be good? If so, sit back and grab a regular kah-fee while this New Yorker gives you the definitive guide to awesome pizza.
 
As a native New Yorker, I take my pizza seriously and I always feel obliged to (unannoyingly) share this passion with
anyone in my vicinity. So, as a community service, I created this vital data visualization for my world-wide recommendations for great pizza.
