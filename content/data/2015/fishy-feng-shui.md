Title: Fishy Feng Shui
Category: data
Slug: fishy-feng-shui
Summary: What does my fish do all day while I'm at work?  Does he nap on the sand, exercise against the filter's current, or just swim around randomly? The pressing answers to these questions and many more are answered within!

As any sensible couple planning for a child, my wife and I are actively working up the evolutionary parenthood
ladder. The first "taking care of something" stage was a flower, which was an overwhelming success despite an
accidental drop from our third story balcony. The followup stage was a fish, and after two months, we are 
passing this test swimmingly!
  
As a caring parent, I want to improve the living conditions of my fish, but his hopes, dreams, and interests
currently elude me. So, taking a data-driven approach, I pointed my Macbook's webcam at the tank with the
intention of NSAing out this information. After taking photos at 30 second intervals for approximately five hours,
I wrote a simple image analysis algorithm that records the fish's location. (This mainly involved a bunch of fancy
filtering and a computationally intensive "Laplacian of Gaussian" blob detection.) The heatmap below shows the most
frequented areas during this time frame:

Wow, my fish really enjoys hanging out near driftwood and dislikes the edges of the tank.  I should definitely consider
buying a bigger tank with plenty of driftwood, while I prepare for stage three: a bunny rabbit!
