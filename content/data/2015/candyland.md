Title: A Low Carb Candyland
Category: data
Slug: candyland
Summary: Candyland, a board game cherished by children for generations, is incredibly socially irresponsible. My proposed update to this classic game is super simple and could fix the ongoing childhood obesity epidemic.
 
Candyland, a game where a group of children take a convoluted path through a diabetes filled utopia, needs a revision.
No child should be exposed to such a gluttonous journey at such an early age.
On the other hand, hipsterfying this into Vegatableland is not an alternative.  It's widely known that the day the Cookie Monster
selected a carrot over a cookie, over ten thousands angels cried in unison.  I believe a happy medium would, at least,
involve a quick closed-loop tour of Candyland that does NOT end at King Candy's suspicious looking castle.
(We, as a society, should not support people who lure children into candy filled houses)

So, what is the best route that visits all the wonders of Candyland while minimizing the total distance traveled. Well,
this is just the famous traveling salesman problem! Using a <a href='https://github.com/chrisvmiller/analytics/blob/master/candyland_route/find_best_path.py'> simulated annealing approach</a>, my proposed path is:
