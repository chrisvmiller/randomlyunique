Title: Simple Synesthesia
Category: data
Slug: simple-synesthesia
Summary: I attempt to visualize music by mapping musical notes to the visible light spectrum.

My wife - a flautist - has a tendency to describe music in terms of colors. This concept is surprisingly difficult for my simpleton brain to comprehend, but I won't allow that to get in my way! Using midi files from my favorite video game - Banjo Kazooie - I colorized the melody in each song as described below:

- **Color:** The note, where higher notes are purple shifted, lower notes are red shifted
- **Width:** How long the note is played
- **Intensity:** Striking force of note, where softer notes are whiter
- **White:** Silence
