Hi, I'm Chris and I'm a Data Scientist in San Francisco. I hold a PhD in Physics with a background in modeling the 
optoelectronic properties of nanomaterials. My professional interests include anything from real-world modeling, 
clean/simple analysis, and bringing data products to life.      
   
In addition to being incredibly humble, I pride myself with my positive and upbeat attitude.  It's extremely difficult
for someone to catch me in a bad mood, which is directly correlated to my amazing wife. If you want to contact me for 
any reason, feel free to send a message! Hope you enjoy my data blog!
