Title: About

I am currently a Data Scientist/Engineer at an early stage startup in San Francisco.  I hold a PhD in Physics with a
background in modeling the optoelectronic properties of nanowires. My interests include anything from 
big data, making data-driven decisions, pushing the needle and an excessive use of meaningless jargon.
   
In addition to being incredibly witty and humble, I pride myself with my positive and upbeat attitude. I also have an 
absolutely perfect wife and pretty darn good life! If you want to contact me for any reason, feel free to send a message :-D

Hope you enjoy my data blog! I post all updates on twitter, so be sure to follow me!
