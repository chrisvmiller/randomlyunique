Title: A Low Carb Candyland
Slug: candyland
Summary: Candyland, a board game targeted at adolescents, has been beloved by children for generations.  However, this game is incredibly socially irresponsible nowadays and requires an update!
 
Candyland, a game where a group of children take a convoluted path through a diabetes filled utopia, needs a revision.
Children should not be exposed to such a gluttonous journey at such a early age given the ongoing childhood obesity epidemic.
On the other hand, hipsterfying this into Vegatableland is not an alternative.  It's widely known that the day the Cookie Monster
choose a carrot over a cookie, over ten thousands angels cried in unison.  I believe a happy medium would, at least,
involve a quick closed-loop tour of Candyland that does NOT end at King Candy's suspicious looking castle.
(We, as a society, should not support people who lure childen into candy filled houses - just ask Hansel and Gretel!)

So, what is the best route that visits all the wonders of Candyland while minimizing the total distance traveled. Well,
this is just the famous traveling salesman problem! Using a simulated annealing approach, my proposed path is:
