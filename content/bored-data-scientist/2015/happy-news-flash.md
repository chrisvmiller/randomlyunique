Title: Happy News Flash
Category: bored
Slug: happy-news-flash
Summary: As an extreme optimist, I wholeheartedly believe life is better today than anytime in history.  This is contrary to popular opinion, but most people are little whiners.  Hopefully, this article will tilt your viewpoint in my direction.

It's hard to argue that anything can be perfect (with the exception of my wife of course...booyah, instant brownie
points), but life is hecka sweet nowadays. We aren't in any world wars, the number of times I worry about being
murdered in my sleep from a Mongolian invasion is significantly low, and devouring a five pound gummy bear
is only one Amazon Prime

As a hint of this positiveness, I performed a rudimentary sentiment analysis on news articles.
Using the New York Times API, I extracted a random sample of top news stories on a weekly basis since 1900. The plot
below shows this estimated sentiment under a three year exponential moving average:

As you can see, we're sightly more happier nowadays. If you're completely convinced otherwise, please keep your 
complaining to yourself.  I'm too busy singing along to my Carly Rae Jepsen and Taylor Swift playlist anyways.
