Summary: Looking to be a star athlete even though you lack any physical talent? Stop going to the boring gym and slowly scooter to the nearest fast food joint to become the ideal goaltender. 

Everytime I watch hockey, I always wonder why every goaltender is in great shape.  Wouldn't a little extra weight make 
saving goals easier? In fact, wouldn't the perfect goalie be fat enough to block the entire net? I think so, let's calculate 
this ideal weight! 

As a person who spent years studying physics, I can unequivocally state that only three shapes exist in nature: 1) Cubes 
2) Cylinders and 3) Spheres. So, it's safe to assume that a perfect goalie is just a cube with a height and width equal to the 
dimensions of the goal and a depth of, let's say, 20 inches. Using the density of fat equal to 0.9 g/cm3, the chart below breaks down 
the target weight for goaltender perfection for a few different sports:
