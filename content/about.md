Hi, I'm Chris and I'm a Data Scientist in San Francisco. I hold a PhD in Physics with a background in modeling the 
optoelectronic properties of nanomaterials. My professional interests include real-world modeling, clean+simple analysis, 
and designing data products.      
   
In addition to my unparalleled humbleness, I pride myself with my positive and upbeat attitude.  It's extremely difficult
for someone to catch me in a bad mood and I kinda have my amazing wife to blame for that. If you want to contact me for 
any reason, feel free to send a message.

Hope you enjoy my blog! :-D
