            </p>


            <p class="article-text">

            </p>


            <p class="article-text">
                <a href="http://www.randomlyunique.com/bored/2015/daily-money-swim/">Daily Money Swim</a>: If you're disgustingly rich, interested in liquid commodities and looking to burn a few extra calories, then save that pivot-table and vlookup the value-scale of the following proposition.

                <a href="http://www.randomlyunique.com/bored/2015/candyland/">A Low Carb Candyland</a>: Candyland, a board game cherished by children for generations, is incredibly socially irresponsible.
